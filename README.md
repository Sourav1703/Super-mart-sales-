​Super-Mart Sales Dashboard
​This repository contains a comprehensive sales dashboard project for a fictional Super-Mart, designed to provide key business insights and enable data-driven decision-making. The dashboard was created using Power BI, demonstrating skills in data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization.

Project Overview
​The Super-Mart Sales Dashboard offers a holistic view of the company's sales performance. It provides interactive and visually compelling insights into sales, orders, and profit trends across various dimensions, including customer segments, regions, payment modes, and product categories.

​Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
​The dashboard focuses on the following primary KPIs, presented prominently for quick analysis:
​Sales: 2M
​Orders: 22K
​Profit: 175K
​Ship Days: 4

​Dashboard Sections and Key Visuals
​The dashboard is structured into several sections, each providing specific insights:
​1. Overall Sales and Profit
​Monthly Sales vs. YOY (Year-over-Year): A line chart tracking monthly sales for 2019 and 2020, allowing for easy comparison of performance across years.
​Monthly Profit vs. YOY: A similar line chart showing the monthly profit trend for 2019 and 2020.
​Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by State: A map visualization of the United States, displaying sales and profit distribution by state. This helps in identifying top-performing and underperforming geographic regions.

​3. Shipping and Product Analysis
​Sum of Sales by Ship Mode: A bar chart that breaks down total sales by shipping method (Standard, Second Class, First Class, Same Day), revealing the most popular and profitable shipping options.
​Sum of Sales by Category: A horizontal bar chart that ranks product categories (Office Supplies, Technology, Furniture) by total sales.
​Sum of Sales by Sub-Category: A horizontal bar chart that provides a more granular view of sales performance within sub-categories (Phones, Chairs, Binders).

​Microsoft Power BI: Used for all stages of the project, including data cleaning, modeling, and dashboard creation.
​Power Query: Leveraged for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to ensure data quality and structure.
​DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized to create custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis (e.g., Year-over-Year comparisons).
